Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap. Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places such as dialogs, modal windows, forms, cards, and toolbars.

Inspired by [Ant Design Button](https://ant.design/components/button/)

## When to use it

---

- To produce things that didn’t exist before (register, submit, save, and more).
- To perform actions (send, delete, edit, cancel, and more).
- To confirm the displayed information.
- Generally, to be used when actions caused by users affect back-end and/or front-end of the application.
